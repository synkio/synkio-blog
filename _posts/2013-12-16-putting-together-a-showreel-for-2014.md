What better time than December to look back on the year and sweep all the best bits into a neat little pile?<!--excerpt--> A showreel, a sizzle, a demo -  they all tend to lead to the same thing: beautiful shots captured with painstaking precision, cut together with the greatest patience only to be slapped over a mediocre music bed.

It's such a let down. I can't count the number of awards shows where you watch the entries with eyes and cover up your ears with horror.  That guitar/take care of business track sounds very 1997, what year is it - nearly 2014?

Synkio has been built by passionate music experts to help the agencies who spend thousands of dollars on regular campaigns get the same quality of music on their showreels. Their work deserves it. Your work deserves it.

We like to think we're making it easy (but tell us if we aren't: [humans@synk.io](mailto:humans@synk.io)). To get started, you simply need to tell the community what kind of Production you're work on and the filtered selection from Synkio's global community of real music pros will suggest a perfect track fitting of all your hard work. A track that took just as much time and care in its creation as your productions have.
