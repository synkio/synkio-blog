I was blown away today when I stumbled across this incredible piece of video. Film-maker Eric Sterman took a Go-Pro and a flying Drone to the North Shore of Oahu<!--excerpt-->, Pipeline in the closing weeks of December 2013 to film some surfers.

What he brought back is nothing short of mesmerising. The video speaks for itself, take some time to watch it.

Disruptive technologies like the combination of cheaper HD cameras and Drones are creating new possibilities for Film-Makers like Eric. Not only is this disruptive force pushing back the boundaries of video, it's changing journalism reporting too, check out this footage of the protests in Turkey last summer.

As you can see, just as tools like Synkio are allowing Film-Makers access to music more easily, technology is disrupting video too - allowing creatives to express and create better, more engaging content than ever before.
