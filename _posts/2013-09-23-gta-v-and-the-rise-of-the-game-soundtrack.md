One of the most talked-about elements about this franchise, and indeed Grand Theft Auto Five is the soundtrack. Rockstar Games -  the creators of the GTA series, have worked hard to deliver _the most compelling game soundtrack ever_ - with over 240 licensed songs over 15 ‘radio’ stations spanning a multitude of genres, from Mexican Electronica to your usual Rock and Pop, presented by the likes of Pam Grier, Kenny Loggins and Bootsy Collins.

The soundtrack, put together meticulously over some months by the team includes a selection of expertly supervised music featuring the likes of NWA, Muse, Pulp, Black Flag, Snoop Dogg, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Queen, Pet Shop Boys and, it has been revealed a number of new up-and-coming artists, too, for example Atlanta based MC ‘Future’.

In the context of GTA V’s runaway success, what is becoming clear is the increasing influence and value of games to the music business. Along with film soundtracks and new artist’s being showcased through advertising synch - Games are now a vital method of both discovery and revenue. It stands to reason that as these relationships become more intertwined, the games and film industry will only grow closer.
