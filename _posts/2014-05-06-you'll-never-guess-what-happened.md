No it won't. It doesn't. It's just a sensational headline to get you to read another listicle...<!--excerpt--> It's finally time to make fun of all these linkbaiters and pointless headlines at [Clickhole.com](http://clickhole.com/)

Yes, it's reached satire status. The Onion, no less, is doing parodies of Upworthy and Buzzfeed, etc.

We're working with Cannes Lions to create a list with some actual substance - the best advertising music of all time... and we need your help. Send us the best ads you've produced that have been made better with music. The winners will be chosen by a group of top music industry experts and we'll discuss the contents and how it affected everyone's IP in Cannes this June.

Email us links to your best ads featuring music - [humans@synk.io](mailto:humans@synk.io)
