Every so often there's a piece of work that really catches your eye. This new, 'interactive' video for Bob Dylan's classic 'Like A Rolling Stone' did just that to us last night<!--excerpt-->. But it has divided opinion. Critics argue that the nature of the video is nowhere near as revolutionary as the spirit of the song, now almost 50 years old "That snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind," is how Bruce Springsteen described hearing the song for the first time at 15.

It's not that the format of the video is wildly revolutionary -  yep, it's interesting and all, but it's the content alongside the concept that really caught us. Whether it's the fictional kids cartoon 'Zoey and Socks' on the 'Just for Kids' channel, or it's 'BCC News', the combination of one of the most timeless songs of all time in combination with an array of new, almost every-day television situations creates an interesting, immersive and rewarding experience.

I spent a good ten minutes flipping between the different channels. A nod to Columbia Records and  [Interlude](http://interlude.fm/) for a viral hit, and a tip of the leopard-skin pill-box hat to Bob Dylan for starting it all.
