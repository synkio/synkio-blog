At Synkio we're always inspired and surprised by what film-makers and creative people are able to do with great technology. It's what we do.<!--excerpt-->

A few weeks back we identified some fantastic drone video from [Eric Sterman's surf videos in Hawaii](http://blog.synk.io/2014/01/17/innovations-in-film-making-drone-cameras.html), it blew us away. The quality of footage and camera work was something else. Today we got inspired all over again by Shaun O'Callaghan's video from a drone, in a VOLCANO.

We hope you'll find it as thought-provoking as we did. All it really needs is a custom or licensed soundtrack -  I'm sure the Glitch Mob would oblige(!)
