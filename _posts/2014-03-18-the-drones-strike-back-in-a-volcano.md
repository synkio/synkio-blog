At Synkio we're always inspired and surprised by what film-makers and creative people are able to do with great technology. It's what we do.<!--excerpt-->

A few weeks back we identified some fantastic drone video from [Eric Sterman's surf videos in Hawaii](http://blog.synk.io/2014/01/17/innovations-in-film-making-drone-cameras.html), they blew us away. The quality of footage and camera work was something else. Today we got inspired all over again by Shaun O'Callaghan's video from a drone, in a VOLCANO.

The combination of Passenger's already massive 2013 track 'Let Her Go' as a masterful sync, and the narrative of the story have really got everybody talking - great work from RSA's director, Jake Scott.
