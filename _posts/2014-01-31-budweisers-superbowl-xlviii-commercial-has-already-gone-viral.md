We tweeted about this advert a few days ago, but I just couldn't resists posting it - it's got everybody going 'Aww'!<!--excerpt--> Remember last year's ad - 'Brotherhood' featuring Fleetwood Mac? Well this year it's the turn of a 10 week old Golden Retriever, a story of friendship and the iconic Budweiser Clydesdales.

The combination of Passenger's already massive 2013 track 'Let Her Go' as a masterful sync, and the narrative of the story have really got everybody talking - great work from RSA's director, Jake Scott.
