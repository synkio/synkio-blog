This week the whole Synkio founding team has been in Cannes for the Cannes Lions. We've done masses of meetings, had a bit too much wine and gave a talk on Friday morning, the subject was the 'Top 10 Music Moments in the History of Advertising'<!--excerpt-->, a list compiled by over 60 music and advertising experts. Here's the list.

### 10 - Oscar Meyer - "Weiner" - 1961

This one was used by Kraft for over 35 years, it's catchy and a classic example of jingle writing at its best.

### 9 - Microsoft - "Start Me Up" - 1995

> "Start Me Up" by __Rolling Stones__

The rumor is that Bill Gates asked Mick Jagger to use the ad and Jagger said 'only if you pay $13m'. So Wild Bill agreed on the spot. Other sources say that was a fabrication by the Stones' crafty PR team.

### 7 - Pepsi - "Creation" - 1987

> "Modern Love" by __David Bowie (featuring Tina Turner)__

This is one of the many Bowie adverts that could have made it into the top 10. This one just feels like such a classic. David Bowie + Tina Turner + Pepsi = Awesome. Also: when doing our research for this we [found a bunch of other great Bowie ads](http://flavorwire.com/424073/a-brief-history-of-david-bowies-tv-commercial-appearances)...

### 6 - T-Mobile - "myFaves Secret Lovers" - 2006

> "Secret Loves" by __Atlantic Starr__

This ad was a surprise entry to the list... but when you see it you'll just understand why it's on here. The timing is absolutely perfect.

### 5 - Volkswagen - "Pink Moon" - 1999

> "Pink Moon" by __Nick Drake__

This one is beautiful, affecting, and well... I love Nick Drake almost as much. The spirit of adventure is strong in this one... It was also VW's first ad to be debuted on the internet.

### 4 - British Airways - "Flower Duet Lakme" - 1989

### 3 - Coca Cola - "I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing" - 1971

Coke later released this ad as a single in 1971 and the track went straight to #1. An interesting thing about that ad: the eventual total cost for the ad was $250,000 a staggering price in 1971 for an advertisement, but by today's standards - nothing much.

### 2 - Chevy - "Like A Rock" - 1991

> "Like A Rock" by __Bob Seger__

Ruggedness. America. Manliness. Chevy. Can't any more than that really...

### 1 - Adidas - "Buy Adidas" - 1986

> "My Adidas" by __Runâ€“D.M.C.__

This ads message is super simple: "Buy Adidas". It's a fantastic example of a clear message made exponentially more powerful by putting an artist and a brand together. It's easy to see why the group of music experts voted it #1.
