We spent a long time thinking about Synkio before we began to build, maybe too long<!--excerpt-->... Songwriters and composers were agitating to start using it but the team wanted to test some things out before we went live, just to make sure we were doing the right thing. Best laid plans...

We hardly expected so many Creative Agencies to express an interest in using the service, but within a few weeks of going live in March we had three or four of the world’s biggest creative agencies submitting briefs, since then the Synkio platform has continued to grow, and we’ve listened to feedback from everybody before rolling out this new set of features which we’re calling __[Synkio Pro](http://synk.io/pro?utm_campaign=blog)__.

[Synkio Pro](http://synk.io/pro?utm_campaign=blog) has been built especially for Creative Agencies. From launch today, participating agencies will have the ability to submit a closed brief to the community, this means that you can be really open and frank with what you want from all the composers, musicians, songwriters and experts - who will agree to a confidentiality agreement before seeing all the details. As well as this we’re offering special invoicing terms, some extra support for multiple logins and a roadmap of features over the coming months that we’re hopeful will make Synkio the first place you think of when you need audio or music.

We’ll continue to support the free version of Synkio too, but this will give us the chance to work more closely with anybody who regularly produces content with music and audio. We’re also making sure that Synkio free continues to develop too, so irregular users can expect certain features to ‘trickle down’.

__Synkio Pro__ is live today at __$45 a month__, for more information go to [synk.io/pro](http://synk.io/pro)
