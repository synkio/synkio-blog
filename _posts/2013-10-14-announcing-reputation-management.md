Consistently, people at creative agencies and film makers have told us that one of the things they love about Synkio is the "quality" of the work produced by the music community<!--excerpt-->, Synkio was always supposed to be an open platform. We created it so that Music People everywhere would be able to get involved in the global licensing market, but so far - it's been a closed selection of hand-selected invitees.

We know this doesn't work in the long term, so today I'm pleased to announce the release of our latest feature, Reputation Management, which will help us to take steps to begin to open up the Music Community to many more people without compromising on quality - it's essential that we can scale up the Music community whilst preserving that. 

Reputation Management is a series of in-line tools that will allow clients to easily rate responses to briefs by the music community, this will create an overall 'Reputation' for music people in Synkio - not just for the quality of your work, but for the relevancy of your responses.

This is great for both sides of the community, Music People will have the option to proudly display an overall reputation on your profiles, so you can offer even more clarity to any clients reviewing your work. And Film Makers, Agencies and Games Developers will be able to see a Music Person's reputation at-a-glance when reviewing work. Crucially, it will be a Music Person's decision whether you want to display that profile, or not, it's up to you. _You control your reputation_.

This is just the first of our releases in the area of Reputation Management, as always we've got many more ideas which will help the music community receive more relevant briefs, and help clients understand more about a a music person's areas of expertise.
