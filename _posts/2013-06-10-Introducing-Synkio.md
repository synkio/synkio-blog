Music is inherently made by humans, for humans - it's difficult to catalogue it with machines. 

Right now, all around the world, there are babies in strollers shaking their chubby little arms and legs like double jointed starfish to tiny speakers spitting out the hits of today. 

Our connection with music is magical, it's primitive, and it's weird. The way we connect with music is WEIRD! And it only gets weirder as we get older. Music defines our considerable attitudes as teenagers, our love lives as adults and is a remarkable link to our memories as we become old fist shaking complainers. 

Music is human and as human is difficult to define. What does it mean to be human? What is good music? There are so many pieces of music  and they are always evolving even as they touch the past. A great song will stick out like a great human being. Something about it is different from the pack and when in the right time and place it can become as much of a hero as any revolutionary leader. But it is about place and time and it's about how we experience it. Hearing a song play in a grocery store won't have the same impact as when we hear it in a movie. Or, a song on the radio won't have the same impact as when it features in our favourite game. The experience is more intimate and the song strikes us in a different way. That's what makes synch so beautiful. When a great song comes to life with a visual it's combined impact can draw tears or elicit a smile. It's a magical remedy that brings us closer to the creation of a real experience. 

So, jobs done, blog post over... music and picture is good. Uhm? Not really. What would be the point of this blog post if we left it at that?

So ( #2), how do we manage the wealth of musical existence into a manageable set of definitive chunks so we can correctly connect it to the equally humongous wealth of synch need? And, when you find the right song how do you license it. Also, what are the liabilities of using a piece of music. So, we saw a bunch of pain points and we were cocky/delusional enough to think we could fix it. 

So, we built Synkio. Synkio connects people who need to license music with people who own or make music. It also builds contracts, briefs, gives context and manages the great existence of musical instances in the only way you can... with humans. Synkio connects the people and takes away the mundane tasks. Synch, score, edit, create! In the meantime, we'll be over here keeping busy building helpful technology that helps you get the unnecessary friction out of the way.
